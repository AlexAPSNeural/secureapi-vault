To create a production-ready `package.json` file for an API-first security layer, we need to include essential dependencies and scripts that support authentication and encryption processes. Below is an example `package.json` file for such a project. It includes common packages used for security and encryption in Node.js applications.

```json
{
  "name": "api-security-layer",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A robust API-first security layer that streamlines authentication and encryption processes.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "build": "babel src -d dist"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "api",
    "security",
    "authentication",
    "encryption"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.1",
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "helmet": "^6.0.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.3.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "morgan": "^1.10.0",
    "express-rate-limit": "^7.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.0",
    "jest": "^29.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.10.0",
    "eslint-config-prettier": "^8.5.0",
    "eslint-plugin-node": "^11.0.0",
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.7.0"
  }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Dependencies:**
  - `express`: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
  - `jsonwebtoken`: For authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  - `bcryptjs`: For hashing passwords.
  - `helmet`: Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
  - `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - `cors`: Middleware to enable CORS.
  - `morgan`: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
  - `express-rate-limit`: Simple and fast rate-limiting middleware for Express.

- **DevDependencies:**
  - `nodemon`: Automatically restarts the server during development.
  - `jest`: JavaScript testing framework.
  - `eslint`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-node`: For code linting.
  - `babel-cli`, `babel-preset-env`: Necessary for Babel to transpile ES6+ code during development and build.

- **Scripts:**
  - `start`: Executes the primary application.
  - `dev`: Runs `nodemon` for automatic restarts during development.
  - `test`: Runs the test suite using Jest.
  - `lint`: Checks for linting errors.
  - `build`: Transpiles source code from ES6+ to a version compatible with older environments.

Ensure to modify the `author` field and other metadata to suit your project specifics. Add any additional packages or scripts needed based on your project's requirements.
